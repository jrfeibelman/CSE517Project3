This is your grade report from the Autograder ran on 2021-04-10 13:15:25. 
For this project we ran 2 evaluation(s) on your committed code. On the kernel_eval evaluation you scored 0 points with our tests. Unfortunately, you failed 8 test(s) on this evaluation: 

Failed Test 1: RBF kernel between two identical data sets should return diagonals of all-ones.

Failed Test 2: Linear kernel seems incorrect.

Failed Test 3: Polynomial kernel with degree p=0 should return all-ones matrix.

Failed Test 4: Polynomial kernel with degree p=1 should return linear kernel +1.

Failed Test 5: Polynomial kernel with p = 3 should be derivable from linear kernel.

Failed Test 6: RBF kernel seems wrong.

Failed Tests 7-10: There was an error in generageQP.
